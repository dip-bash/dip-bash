# 💫 About Me:
👋 I'm a BTech CSE student. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, particularly the OFFENSIVE aspects, such as bug hunting and PENTESTING. My strength is that I am a SELF LEARNER; I have no mentor, so I don't have a sophisticated learning path. Instead, I learn by making mistakes. I am well-versed in LINUX, COMPUTER NETWORKING, and system level SCRIPTING
